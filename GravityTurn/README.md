# GravityTurn

This is a Kerbal Space Program plugin that will auto-pilot most crafts
to a nearly maximum efficiency gravity turn launch.

The autopilot will launch to a given speed, initiate a slight turn, and 
follow the course of that turn all the way to a low orbit.  Mostly this
involves adjusting the throttle to keep the curvature of the orbit
ascending to the desired prograde.

The plugin will handle staging as well as it can.  Several parameters
are adjustable to fine tune a launch to a particular vehicle.  But the 
default parameters are usually enough to get to orbit using about 
3300 m/s of delta-V or less.
